# Connection-and-programming-of-Electronic-circuit
This project uses an Arduino Uno to control 8 servo motors. Connect the servos to digital pins 2-9. The code moves the first 6 servos to 180 degrees, the last 2 to 90 degrees, then all to 0 degrees, with a 1500ms delay between movements. Connect the servos to the breadboard, upload the code, and the servos will move as specified.
